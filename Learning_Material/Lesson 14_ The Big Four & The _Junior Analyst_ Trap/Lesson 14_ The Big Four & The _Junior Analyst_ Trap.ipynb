    "# Module 2: Frontier Models\n",
    "## Lesson 14: The Big Four & The \"Junior Analyst\" Trap\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 Overview\n",
    "We survey the current landscape of Frontier Labs and their flagship products. We also discuss the most dangerous pitfall for AI Engineers: treating the LLM as an oracle rather than a tireless but fallible junior employee.\n",
    "\n",

    "| Lab | Model Series | Chat Product | Engineering Note |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **OpenAI** | GPT-5 / GPT-4o | ChatGPT | The benchmark. \"GPT-5\" (Hybrid) is powerful but slow; \"GPT-4o\" is the daily driver. |\n",
    "| **Anthropic** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet / Opus | Claude.ai | Known for the best coding performance and largest context window usage. |\n",
    "| **Google** | Gemini 2.5 / 1.5 Pro | Gemini Advanced | Deeply integrated into the Google workspace; massive context window. |\n",
    "| **xAI** | Grok | Grok | Real-time access to X (Twitter) data. |\n",
    "| **DeepSeek** | DeepSeek V3 / R1 | DeepSeek Chat | **The Odd One Out:** A Frontier-class lab that Open Sources its best models. |\n",

    "### ⚠️ The Engineering Reality: \"Confidence != Truth\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The Knowledge Cutoff\n",
    "* **The Problem:** Models are frozen in time. If you ask Gemini to fix a library released *yesterday*, it will confidently Hallucinate a fix using APIs that don't exist, or lecture you that the library doesn't exist.\n",
    "* **The Fix:** **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**. We must inject current documentation into the context window (we will learn this in Module 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The \"Junior Analyst\" Metaphor\n",
    "* **Concept:** Treat LLMs like a brilliant intern who has read every book in the world but has zero real-world experience.\n",
    "* **The Danger:** If a Junior Analyst hits a roadblock (e.g., a \"Model Not Found\" error), they might panic and write 400 lines of code to patch the library instead of checking if the model name was just a typo.\n",
    "* **Your Role:** You are the **Senior Engineer**. You must review the strategy, not just the output.\n",
    "    * *Bad:* \"Write this code for me.\" -> (Copy/Paste blindly).\n",
    "    * *Good:* \"Propose a solution.\" -> (Review architecture) -> \"Okay, implement it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Stack Overflow's Decline\n",
    "* **Observation:** Developers rarely search for error codes anymore; they paste them into Claude/ChatGPT.\n",
    "* **Risk:** This creates a feedback loop where we stop understanding the *root cause* because the AI fixes the *symptom* too quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Strategic Takeaway\n",
    "**\"Trust, but Verify.\"**\n",
    "When generating code, always ask yourself: *\"Did it just solve the problem, or did it write a workaround for a problem that shouldn't exist?\"*"
