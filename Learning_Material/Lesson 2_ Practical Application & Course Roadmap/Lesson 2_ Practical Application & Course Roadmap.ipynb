    "# Module 1: Course Introduction & Local Setup\n",
    "## Lesson 2: Practical Application & Course Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 Overview\n",
    "In this lesson, we move beyond the basic \"Hello World\" to a practical application: using a local LLM as a **Spanish Language Tutor**. The lesson demonstrates how a generic model can be repurposed for specific tasks through conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the instructor outlines the **8-Week Engineering Roadmap**:\n",
    "1.  **Foundations**: Local setup & basics.\n",
    "2.  **Frontier Models**: Working with SOTA (State of the Art) APIs.\n",
    "3.  **Open Source**: Deep dive into local model weights.\n",
    "4.  **Model Selection**: Choosing the right tool for the job.\n",
    "5.  **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Connecting LLMs to private data.\n",
    "6.  **Fine-Tuning (Frontier)**: Customizing closed-source models.\n",
    "7.  **Fine-Tuning (Open Source)**: Training local models on custom datasets.\n",
    "8.  **Agentic AI**: Building autonomous systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗝️ Key Concepts\n",
    "* **Persona / System Prompting**: The technique of instructing an LLM to adopt a specific role (e.g., \"You are a Spanish Tutor\"). This restricts the model's output space to be more relevant.\n",
    "* **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: The lesson briefly highlights models that \"show their thinking\" (often in gray text) before outputting the final answer. This \"reasoning trace\" usually improves accuracy for complex tasks.\n",
    "* **Latency vs. Intelligence**: The trade-off observed when switching between small models (fast, conversational) and larger models (slower, more nuanced).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Technical Implementation: The \"Spanish Tutor\"\n",
    "To turn a raw model into a specific tool (like a tutor), we must use **System Prompts**.\n",
    "*Note: In the `ollama` library, we pass this in the `messages` list with the role `'system'`.*"

    "*The following experiments focus on Prompt Engineering and Observation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experiment 1: The \"System Prompt\" Impact\n",
    "**Objective:** See how much the `system` role actually changes behavior compared to just asking in the user prompt.\n",
    "**Test:**\n",
    "1.  **Without System Prompt:** User says: *\"Teach me Spanish.\"* -> Model gives a generic plan.\n",
    "2.  **With System Prompt:** (As defined in code) -> Model immediately acts as a conversation partner.\n",
    "**Observation:** Strong system prompts are essential for building \"Agents\" later in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experiment 2: Temperature Check\n",
    "**Engineering Challenge:**\n",
    "Modify the Python code to include `options={'temperature': 0.1}` inside the `ollama.chat` call.\n",
    "* **Hypothesis:** Lower temperature (0.1) should make the \"Tutor\" more rigid and grammatical. Higher temperature (0.8) might make it more slang-heavy or creative."
