    "# Module 1: Course Introduction & Local Setup\n",
    "## Lesson 3: Environment Setup with Cursor & uv\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 Overview\n",
    "This lesson transitions from model inference to **Environment Engineering**. We configure the development environment using **Cursor** (an AI-first Code Editor) and **uv** (a next-generation Python package manager written in Rust). The goal is to establish a deterministic, high-performance sandbox for building our applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗝️ Key Concepts\n",
    "* **Cursor IDE**: A fork of VS Code designed for AI-assisted coding. It includes a built-in terminal (`Ctrl + Backtick`) and Markdown preview support.\n",
    "* **uv (by Astral)**: A modern replacement for `pip` and `conda`.\n",
    "    * *Why use it?* It is written in Rust and is orders of magnitude faster than traditional installers.\n",
    "    * *Function:* It handles Python version management and dependency resolution instantly.\n",
    "* **Dependency Sync**: The command `uv sync` reads the project requirements and creates an exact replica of the instructor's environment in a local `.venv` (Virtual Environment) folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Technical Implementation: Automated Setup Script\n",
    "*While the lesson teaches manual CLI commands, as engineers we automate environment checks. Below is a Python utility script to verify your `uv` installation and sync dependencies programmatically.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "1.  **Install Cursor**: [cursor.com](https://cursor.com)\n",
    "2.  **Install uv**:\n",
    "    * *Mac/Linux*: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`\n",
    "    * *Windows*: `powershell -c \"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex\"`"
