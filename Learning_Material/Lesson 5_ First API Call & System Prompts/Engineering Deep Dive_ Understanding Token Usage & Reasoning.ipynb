    "# 🧠 Engineering Deep Dive: Understanding Token Usage & Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 Overview\n",
    "As an LLM Engineer, the `CompletionUsage` object is your primary dashboard for cost and performance. It reveals not just \"how much\" text was generated, but **how the model thought** to get there. Understanding this structure is critical for optimizing latency and budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 The Anatomy of Usage\n",
    "When you receive a response from the OpenAI API (and compatible providers), it includes a `usage` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "CompletionUsage(\n",
    "    prompt_tokens=14, \n",
    "    completion_tokens=652, \n",
    "    total_tokens=666, \n",

    "🗝️ Key Metrics Explained\n",
    "1. The Basics (The Bill)\n",
    "prompt_tokens: The input you sent (System Prompt + User Message + History).\n",
    "\n",
    "completion_tokens: The total output generated by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "total_tokens: The sum of the above. This is the number you are billed for.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The \"Hidden\" Cost: Reasoning Tokens\n",
    "Modern \"Reasoning Models\" (like OpenAI o1 or preview models) perform a \"Chain of Thought\" (CoT) process before outputting the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "reasoning_tokens: Tokens generated during the model's internal scratchpad phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visibility: Invisible (You do not see these in the final string).\n",
    "\n",
    "Billing: Billable (You pay for them as if they were output text).\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Visible\" Output: $$ \\text{Visible Text} = \\text{Completion Tokens} - \\text{Reasoning Tokens} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ Engineering Trap: In your example, the model generated 652 tokens but 576 were reasoning. You paid for 652 tokens to get a ~76 token answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency: ~11% of tokens were result, ~89% were overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: This is acceptable for complex logic, but wasteful for simple greetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Prompt Caching\n",
    "cached_tokens: Tokens that the API recognized from a previous request (usually found in prompt_tokens_details).\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit: Cached tokens are typically 50% cheaper and result in lower latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategy: Structure your prompts so the static parts (huge system instructions, RAG context) come first to maximize cache hits.\n",
    "\n",
    "🛠️ Python Utility: Usage Analyzer\n",
    "A helper function to print a clean cost/performance report after every API call."
