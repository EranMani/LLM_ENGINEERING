    "## Lesson 6: Building a Website Summarizer\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 Overview\n",
    "In this lesson, we combine all previous concepts—web scraping, system prompting, and API calls—to build a functioning application. We create a reusable pipeline that takes a URL, extracts its text, and uses GPT-4o-mini to generate a summary in a specific tone (e.g., \"Snarky\" or \"Professional\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗝️ Key Concepts\n",
    "* **Prompt Construction Functions**: Instead of hardcoding prompts, we write Python functions (`messages_for`) to dynamically build the context window based on input data.\n",
    "* **Tone Engineering**: Modifying the `system` role to drastically change the output style without changing the underlying data.\n",
    "* **Server-Side Scraping**: The lesson uses a basic `requests` or `BeautifulSoup` approach.\n",
    "    * *Limitation:* This only works for static HTML. It fails on Single Page Applications (SPAs) like React/Vue sites that require JavaScript rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Technical Implementation: The Pipeline\n",
    "The architecture consists of three stages:\n",
    "1.  **Fetch**: Get raw text from URL.\n",
    "2.  **Construct**: Format text into User/System messages.\n",
    "3.  **Inference**: Send to OpenAI."
