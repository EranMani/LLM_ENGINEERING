    "# Module 1: Foundations\n",
    "## Lesson 7: The Engineering Roadmap & Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 Overview\n",
    "Day 2 begins with a strategic overview of the \"LLM Engineering Stack.\" The instructor emphasizes a \"Commercial Impact\" philosophy—learning not just for theory, but to build viable products (startup or enterprise).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ The 3-Layer Engineering Stack\n",
    "The course is structured around three distinct layers of abstraction. As engineers, we must master all three:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Models (The Foundation)\n",
    "* **Open Source vs. Closed Source:** When to use Llama 3 vs. GPT-4.\n",
    "* **Multimodal:** Handling Images and Audio.\n",
    "* **Selection Strategy:** Choosing the right model for the specific task (Latency vs. Intelligence).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Tools & Frameworks (The Glue)\n",
    "* **Hugging Face:** The hub for models and datasets.\n",
    "* **LangChain:** Orchestration of chains.\n",
    "* **Gradio:** Rapid UI prototyping (similar to NiceGUI but for ML).\n",
    "* **Weights & Biases:** Experiment tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Techniques (The Logic)\n",
    "* **Prompt Engineering:** Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought.\n",
    "* **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):** Connecting to external data.\n",
    "* **Fine-Tuning:** Specializing models on custom data.\n",
    "* **Agents:** Autonomous systems that use tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Best Practices for this Course\n",
    "* **Action over Theory:** \"Don't just watch, type.\" (Or in our case, build & extend).\n",
    "* **Public Building:** Submit Pull Requests (PRs) to the course repo and share \"Personal Projects\" on LinkedIn to build a portfolio.\n",
    "* **Python Level:** Intermediate Python (Generators, Decorators, List Comprehensions) is recommended. *Note: We are already using advanced concepts like Async/Await in our NiceGUI apps.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Recap: What we achieved in Day 1\n",
    "* [x] Local Inference with Ollama (CLI).\n",
    "* [x] API Key Management (`.env`).\n",
    "* [x] System vs. User Prompts.\n",
    "* [x] First Tool: Website Summarizer."
