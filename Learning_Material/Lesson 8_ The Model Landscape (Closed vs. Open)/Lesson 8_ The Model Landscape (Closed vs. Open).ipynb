    "# Module 2: Frontier Models\n",
    "## Lesson 8: The Model Landscape (Closed vs. Open)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 Overview\n",
    "This lesson defines the \"Frontier Model\" landscape. We categorize models into two primary buckets: **Closed Source** (Proprietary/Paid) and **Open Source** (Open Weights/Free to Run). The \"Frontier\" typically refers to the cutting-edge closed models that require massive capital to train.\n",

    "### 🗝️ Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Closed Source (The \"Frontier\")\n",
    "* **Definition:** Models where the weights, training data, and architecture are proprietary. You access them via API (Pay-per-token).\n",
    "* **The \"Big Four\" Labs:**\n",
    "    * **OpenAI (GPT Series):** The market leader. Known for **GPT-4o** (and the instructor's future-referenced \"GPT-5\"). Best general-purpose reasoning.\n",
    "    * **Anthropic (Claude Series):** Founded by former OpenAI employees. Known for **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (often preferred by coders). Focuses on safety and massive context windows.\n",
    "    * **Google (Gemini Series):** Deep integration with the Google ecosystem. **Gemini 1.5 Pro** has a massive context window (up to 2M tokens).\n",
    "    * **xAI (Grok):** Elon Musk's lab. Known for \"Grok,\" which has real-time access to X (Twitter) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Open Source (Open Weights)\n",
    "* **Definition:** Models where the parameters (weights) are public. You can run them locally (Ollama) or host them on your own cloud.\n",
    "* **Nuance:** Often called \"Open Weights\" because while you get the model, you don't always get the training data or the recipe used to create it.\n",
    "* **Key Players:** Meta (Llama), Mistral, and specialized community fine-tunes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 The Frontier Family Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "| Lab | Flagship Model (API) | Specialty |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o / o1 | General Reasoning, Instruction Following |\n",
    "| **Anthropic** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Coding, Creative Writing, Nuance |\n",
    "| **Google** | Gemini 1.5 Pro | Long Context (Books/Codebases), Multimodal |\n",
    "| **xAI** | Grok-2 | Real-time News/Social Data |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Engineering Takeaway\n",
    "As an LLM Engineer, you do not \"marry\" one model. You choose the right tool for the job.\n",
    "* *Need Logic/Math?* Use **OpenAI o1**.\n",
    "* *Need Coding?* Use **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**.\n",
    "* *Need to process a 500-page PDF?* Use **Gemini 1.5 Pro**."
