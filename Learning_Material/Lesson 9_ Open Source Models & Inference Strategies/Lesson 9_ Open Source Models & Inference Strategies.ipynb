    "# Module 2: Frontier Models\n",
    "## Lesson 9: Open Source Models & Inference Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 Overview\n",
    "While Frontier Labs (OpenAI, Anthropic) guard their secrets, the Open Source community provides models where the **Weights** are public. This lesson covers the key players in open source and the three primary architectural patterns for consuming LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏛️ The Open Source Hall of Fame\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model Family | Creator | Notable Feature |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Llama (3.x)** | Meta | The industry standard. Comes in \"Laptop size\" (1B, 3B, 8B) and \"Server size\" (70B, 405B). |\n",
    "| **Mistral / Mixtral** | Mistral AI | Known for **MoE (Mixture of Experts)** architecture, which activates only a subset of parameters per token for efficiency. |\n",
    "| **Qwen** | Alibaba | A powerful, often underrated model series from China. Strong performance in coding and logic. |\n",
    "| **DeepSeek** | DeepSeek AI | The \"Disruptor.\" Achieved frontier capability at a fraction of the training cost (~$4M vs OpenAI's $100M+). Uses **Distillation** to train smaller models on synthetic data from larger ones. |\n",
    "| **Phi** | Microsoft | Specialized Small Language Models (SLMs) excellent for reasoning on mobile/edge devices. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Key Engineering Concept: Distillation\n",
    "* **Definition:** The process of training a small \"Student\" model using the output (synthetic data) of a large \"Teacher\" model.\n",
    "* **Example:** DeepSeek-R1 (Distilled) is actually a Llama or Qwen base model that was fine-tuned on logic data generated by the massive 671B DeepSeek model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ The 3 Modes of Inference\n",
    "As an engineer, you choose how to consume the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The Product (SaaS)\n",
    "* **Example:** ChatGPT, Claude.ai.\n",
    "* **Pros:** UI, History, Memory included.\n",
    "* **Cons:** Manual (Human) usage only; not for code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The Cloud API (MaaS - Model as a Service)\n",
    "* **Direct:** `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`.\n",
    "* **Managed:** AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex, Azure AI.\n",
    "* **Routers:** OpenRouter (One API key for all models).\n",
    "* **High-Speed Hardware:** **Groq** (Note: distinct from Elon's Grok). Uses LPUs (Language Processing Units) for near-instant inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Direct / Local Inference\n",
    "Running the \"Raw Code\" yourself.\n",
    "* **Hugging Face (`transformers`):** The \"Manual\" way. You load Python code and weights into memory. High control, high complexity.\n",
    "* **Ollama:** The \"Packaged\" way. Wraps the model in optimized C++ (`llama.cpp`) and exposes a local server. Low control, high ease-of-use."
